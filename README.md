<!-- Question 1: Difference between var, let, and const -->

- `var` is function-scoped and can be redeclared or updated.  
- `let` is block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.  
- `const` is block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared; it is used for constants.  

<!-- Question 2 : Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter() -->

- `map()` creates a new array by transforming each element of the original array.  
- `forEach()` executes a function on each array element but does not return a new array.  
- `filter()` creates a new array containing elements that meet a specified condition.  
  <!-- !-- Question 3 : Arrow functions in ES6 --> -->

- Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions using the `=>` syntax.  
- They inherit the `this` value from the surrounding context, unlike regular functions.  
- Often used for short, simple function expressions.  

<!-- question 4 : Destructuring assignment in ES6 -->

- Allows extracting values from arrays or objects into separate variables.  
- Makes code cleaner and reduces the need to access properties individually.  

<!-- question 5: Template literals in ES6  -->

- Template literals use backticks (``) to define strings.  
- They allow embedding variables and expressions directly using `${}`.  
- Unlike traditional string concatenation with `+`, template literals are easier to read and write, especially for multi-line strings.
